This simple addon makes it super easy to get the modelname from 53859 objects by entering their hash
in your F8 console (in FiveM). 

This will instantly report back the (known) modelname for the hash you've entered (all hashes are in int32 btw)


Usage of this list in or resource in your own project is allowed, however PLEASE DO CREDIT APPROPIATELY!
Gathering all the information, sorting the list, preparing them in multiple styles for others to use etc was
A LOT of work, so please respect that and show some credits where needed :)

Have fun,
